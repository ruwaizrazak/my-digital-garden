Second Brain, I've been hearing this term for a while and I thought of implementing the second brain mainly cause of two reasons.
1. I will be able to remember more things systematically
2. Im scared of being infected by Alzheimers

How am I planning to build a second brain is rather dubios. As of now, I have only two methods.
1. I will be building notes using [[3 Resources/Obsidian\|Obsidian]]
2. I will be publishing everything in a public platform using [[3 Resources/Jekyll\|Jekyll]]

The latter would be happening a bit later, But for now, I really need to learn on how to use obsidian in an effective manner

I was inspired by the book [[3 Resources/Second Brain By Tiago Forte\|Second Brain By Tiago Forte]] by Tiago forte.

Recently [[3 Resources/Matt D’avella on second brain\|Matt D’avella on second brain]] posted a video about second brain [in youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_44XEVOwek&pp=ygUzaSBsZWFybmVkIGEgcHJvZHVjdGl2aXR5IHN5c3RlbSBmb3Igb3JnYW5pemluZyBsaWZl)
