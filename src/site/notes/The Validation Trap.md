## Notes
•  all of us want validation

•  people who seeks validation have two problems:

•  One, they constantly need other peoples approval and validation to feel that they are a good person, to feel pleasant emotions, or to even feel alive.

•  two, they feel shame or guilt or anger or loneliness or anxiety or confusion or other painful emotions when someone disapproves of and invalidates them, which then often leads to dysfunctional behavior to manage all of it.

•  we can’t be in the good book of everyone
