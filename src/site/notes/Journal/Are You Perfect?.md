Perfect. Thats the first thing every soul want to be. Its a temptation for everyone, everyone wants it, yet none achieved it.

We all were made to dreamt being perfect, we dreamt as if its the biggest thing on earth, we felt that thats the only thing that could keep us moving, thats the only thing that could bring success to us.

But, What is this? Being Perfect? What the hell that is? Is it like being like a Steve Jobs? or Abraham Lincoln? Or Theodore Roosevelt? No, no, if we ask their colleagues or families, each of them got some kinda imperfections in them.

I once heard my friend saying about her life partner, she was saying that he should be cute, intelligent, caring, and perfect for her in every sense. Then i questioned her, What is Perfect for her? she replied “should understand, should make her comfort and blah blah blaaaah”. Nice, i would say. But then, it struck me. There isn’t anything called Perfect, Its like how you see it.

My friend’s way of being perfect was kinda abhorrent for me, i never liked her definition at all.its like one of the usual debate between Ferrari fans and Mclarens, The Ferrari fans might say naturally aspirated engines are better than Turbo charged engines, but then Mclaren fans might object it and go for the turbo charged one, being a neutral and obsessed by all of those wonderful machines, im okay with either of them. So thats how the things are, people define the terms like “success” and “Perfect” according to their will, and they are correct.

So here is what i wanna say:
“None of us are perfect, all have little imperfections in them which i like to call as idiosyncrasies and peccadillos. The moment you start loving your partner’s peccadillos and jells into it and he loves yours is the exact moment that makes you and your partner as the perfect for each other, and when that moment comes to you, grab it with all your heart, coz its not something that happen to every couple”.

Realise your imperfections, work on them, and realise that none remains perfect.
