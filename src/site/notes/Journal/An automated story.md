I once read quote which says “Be the lazy guy in the room so that you might find easy ways to do the tasks in a legitimate way”. 

Well, i agree to that, what i always believe is its not about how hard you try, its about how effectively you try. Which means you can dig a 10ft pit using a shovel for 3 hours of more and later claim that you worked hard, or you can use easier ways such as assigning an Excavator for that. The latter is expensive, but your time might value more.

When it comes to your computers, it wont be that expensive at all. You can easily perform the tasks easily with few scripts, and thats the beauty about it.

### My experience with the Automator.

From the day i bought my mac, I've been looking at this tiny robot, who looks appealing and flaunting a label “*Automator*”. I must agree that, its appealing and i couldn’t figure out what it really is and i really didn't invested much time in checking it (damn me).

We often says that, the examination time will boost our brain and increases curiosities and a thirst to learn new things but not from syllabus, Thats the same thing happened with me since last few days.

i started to invest my time in it and i started to learn what this *Automator* really is, and This thing really helped me to solve one of my problem which was bothering me since long.

Being a human, who loves to be organised, i hated my cluttered download folder. It was a mess. Lots of movies, Music Files,Documents,.DMGs and more. I hated it.

Then i self taught my self to create a folder action using *Automator* Which will copy the Files in the download folder to the appropriate folder in the moment download them, but they leaves the images in the subfolder. The latter is important for me, as i used to fiddle with lots of Websites templates and Other Packages, I don't want this feature to ruin the folder hierarchy.

Which means, i don't have to spend my time to search where the hell is that file in the download folder, instead i can straightly move towards the appropriate folder and do the thing which i was supposed to do. Cool, isn't it?

### A Note to Other Mac Owners

Hello, I might be a noobie in this or you might consider me as a freak. But believe this, Your wonderful machine is actually Bruce Wayne Who have the potential to be the batman, All you have to do is to provide the requirements.

### To the Linux Owners

Linux, The brother from the same mother (Unix), is the captain Rogers. You can make him look like weak, and impotent. But when you give him little tweaks he will be the Captain America.

### To the windows users

Please identify yourself.

Thank you.
