Most of us read newspapers every day. for some, its a ritual, and for the rest its once in a blue moon. However, both these categories gets used to the news which brings the death of someone who we once knew, who were something to us.

Some of these news made us cry, some made us surprised, while some even failed to change our expressions, some of the names in these news could be our friends, relatives, partners or complete strangers.

Even though we used to hear these news everyday, we still remain unaffected. Of course, we may weep or frown after listening to some of them. But after few days we forget everything. Yes, the ability to forget is one of the bless.

But now, we are overusing this bless and hence turning it to a curse. Regardless of our religion, we all are aware of the fact that one day, we will die. and thus we shall return to the place where we all came from. 

We all dream about future, we all plan something for our future, and yes, thats necessary. We have to plan all the things which we want to achieve. as you might have heard, 

“Fail to plan is the planning to fail.”

So what am i talking about? you might be feeling bells ringing in your head by this time. so lets make this clear, planning is important, but along with this you might need a back up plan, so that you won’t run out of options once the first plan blows up.

So, why this back up plan? it all comes from the universal fact that all these things aren’t in our control, look to the past, 
The Portugal, once own the biggest naval fleet and now where are they? The Brits, now they are nowhere near their history, Turkey, all those countries there weren’t a match for them during those days. But now, its all a laugh.

==No body vowed you anything about the future, and no one ever will. You have no guarantee about the next second, you could be alive or dead, but still, thats not in your hand. Make a plan, and make few more, The fact that you aren’t the lord is enough for you to make 1000 mistakes.==
