“I spent my whole childhood wishing I were older and now I'm spending my adulthood wishing I were younger”.

Ah the childhood, for some, even the word brings smile, it makes you just lost in your thoughts, but for others its a nightmare. 

We all heard stories about childhood, most of them are with happy ending. We never read or head about anything that don’t end happily. We read about Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Fin, Harry Potter and all those things which ends in a “good way”. 

We never read about the lives of those legends who lived in poverty and then changed the world in an astonishing manner, the legends like Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon Bonaparte’ and all those legends who changed the world despite of their challenging childhood.

But, we don’t read about it, we don’t want the bitter stories, we want to live in our fantasies and all those funny stuffs in it, right? Ah, What a shame!

The thing about being children is something is divine, something fantastic, its about living innocent and expressing ourselves with cuteness and with immense love.

As far as I’ve heard, the childhood is the mould of any personalities, it’s the one which makes you what you are. When coupled with enthusiasm and reasoning it could provide you to build the foundation that holds an enormous personality. 

Keep the above paragraph in your mind, deal with your kids as if you are dealing with a great guy, so that they will be raised to a great soul. Respect your kids so that they may respect you, show your kindness to them so that they will shower your kindness to you.
