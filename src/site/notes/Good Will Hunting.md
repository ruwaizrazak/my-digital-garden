> How you like them apples?

> People call those as imperfections, but these idiosyncracies are the ones which makes us remember someone who is so close to us

I used to remember the movie for this quote, and then for [[Peccadillos\|Peccadillos]] and for [[Idiosyncrasies\|Idiosyncrasies]] 

There are [[Movies that amazed me\|Movies that amazed me]], left me in awe and made me cry like a baby. and Good will hunting is definitely one among that. 

These huge monologues that the characters, especially Sean williams, has made me to question my life choices and to be more empathic towards humans.  As a [[UX designer\|UX designer]], I often think about delivering great experiences for the users, but then, in the case of a movie, a better experience is when a movie could talk to the audience and then make them think about their choices in lives.
