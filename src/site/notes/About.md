## Why?
So, once upon a time, there lived a guy with lot of questions and lots of topics to talk about. He had his own opinions about most of the things similar to other humans, and likewise, he thought of sharing his thoughts via web.

He started with Blogspot, Wordpress, self hosted wordpress, [[Design and Technology/Static sites\|Static sites]] such as Jekyll along with github pages. But, there was a problem. These platforms, except jekyll were not build the way he wanted, and with Jekyll, it was bit hard (*Subjectively*) to link multiple pages back and forth.

But then, He stumbled upon something similar that caters to his needs and it was excellent. Something simple, straight and hell, cross platform too, something thats exactly this.

## Site info
- This site is made using [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] and https://dg-docs.ole.dev/. 
- The theming hasnt done yet, which I need to do ðŸ¤“

## Navigation
You might feel that the navigation is unorthodox, as in not based on a category. and thats due to the fact that while most of us would like things structured, our thoughts could be severely under-structured. Currently, there is a search option on the top and the pages are extensively linked to each other.
