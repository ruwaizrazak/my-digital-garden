(Randu Neela Matsyangal)

I started the book with an intention of reading 30 pages before bedtime and before I knew it, I completed the whole book (200 pages) in a jiffy.

## Whats the book about?
The book, in its entirety talks about the story of 3 people, Neelima, Anwar, Munniyamma (Muneesa) and how the people they met changes their life's course of action.

==The books reminds the audience to be civil about their opinions and be cautious about their judgements about other people's lives it could potentially destroy lives.==
