## Chapter 1 : Mismatch makes us misfits
- Inclusion is about challenging the status quo and fighting for hard-won victories.
- People's touchpoints with each other and with society are full of mismatched interactions. Design is a source of these mismatches and can also be a remedy
- Inclusion is ongoing, imperfect and not nice
- Exclusion isnt inherently negative. But atleast it should be an intentional choice rather than accidental harm.


## Chapter 2: Shut In, Shut Out
- The Shut-in Shut-out model of inclusion can make it seem like exclusion is a fixed state, rather than an active choice.
- Reframing exclusion as a cycle helps us recognize the ways that our design choices can lead to mismatches
- The Five Elements of the cycle of exclusion are interrelated. Each can be useful place to start shifting toward inclusion
	- These are the five elements
		1. **Why we make?** We will focus on the motivation that are innate to the problem solver
		2. **Who makes it?** This is the problem solver, the person who us accountable for the success of a solution.
		3. **How it's made?** These are the methods and resources employed by the problem solver.
		4. **Who uses it?** These are the assumptions that the problem solver makes about the people who interact with, receive or benefit from solution.
		5. **What we make?** This is what the problem solver creates.

## Chapter 3 : The Cycle of Exclusion

- Mismatched designs contribute to societal invisibility of certain groups, like people with disabilities.
- When a designed objects rejects a person, it can feel like social rejection and approximate physical pain
- Exclusion habits stem from a belief that we cant change aspects of society that were originally set into motion by someone other than ourselves
- As we grow old, our abilities and inabilities will change but the design wont. When we are designing a product we need to consider these facts as well.

## Chapter 4 : Inclusive Designers

**Three Skills of successful inclusive designers **
1. Identify ability biases and mismatched interactions between people and world.
2. Create a diversify of ways to participate in experience.
3. Design for interdependence and bring complementary skills together.

**What is disability?**
> "A complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person's body and features of the society in which they live" - World Health Organization on Disability

The above quote makes us to think disability as a mismatched human interaction, rather than a personal health condition.

**Definition of Inclusive Design**

> "Inclusive design doesn't mean that you are designing one thing for all people. You are designing a diversity of ways to participate so that everyone have the sense of belonging." - Susan Goltsman

Based on the quote above Microsoft defined Inclusive Design as methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives.

*When we are differentiating Accessibility with Inclusive Design, Keep in mind that the former is an attribute while the latter is a method.*

**Takeaways**

- Exclusive Habits
	1. Creating solutions with only one fixed way to participate.
	2. Creating solutions using our own abilities as a baseline, known as ability biases.
	3. Treating accessibility and inclusion as an afterthought or only meeting the minimum legal criteria. 

- How to shift toward inclusion
	1. Consider diversity in terms of human interactions and how people change over time.
	2. Identify ability biases and mismatched interactions. that are related to your solutions.
	3. Create a diversity of ways to participate to an experience.
	4. Design for interdependence and bring complementary skills together. 
	5. Build a basic literacy in accessibility, and grow a depth of expertise in the specific accessibility criteria that are relevant to your solutions.
	6. Adopt a more flexible definition of a designer. Open up our processes and invite contributions from people.
