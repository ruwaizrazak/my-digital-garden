1.  Earlier in your careers its best to embrace the “Junior” title and focus a lot on learning

2.  To achieve good user experience design, we should understand business and technical side of the product.

3.  UX and Engineers aren’t meant to be foe. UX needs engineers as much as Engineers need UX. The sooner we can get rid of egos and work together, the faster we’ll build great product.

4.  I haven’t seen a front-end engineer who doesn’t care about UX

5.  Learn product and technical language and use it for converse respectively

6.  UX research is inevitable

7.  Shipped work is never the final one. Observe how your users interact with that and then iterate.

8.  Experiments are not just a PM thing. Plan for experiments as well

9.  Quantitative Data can be a huge help. But it can often deceive you, if you lack context.

10.  If you want to be a good designer, be a student, scientist and artist, in that order.
