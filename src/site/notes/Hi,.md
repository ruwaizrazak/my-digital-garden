Welcome to my digital garden.

‚ùì**What is this?** : A repository that I've been wanting to build to log whatever I've absorbed through out my life. This could be the snippet of articles, videos and books that I've come across along with raw or slightly processed thoughts. 

You can click on all the links and reach a lot of nice places on the internet to read or watch a lot of nice things  a lot nice topics.

Broadly, This garden contains converse about Design, Humans and technology. There can also be topics that could overlap above like learning and journey.

üö´ **What this isn't?** A blog, that contains super processed thoughts, or a repository of things to download. 

‚öôÔ∏è **Things that are still in development**
- Transferring notes about the books I was fortunate to read during this period
- Aesthetics of the site
- Author Pages

ü´§**Wait! What?** Its okay to be confused. I got you. I was confused as hell when I saw knowledge aggregator (or digital garden) for the first time. If you dont have a clue of whats happening, you can check the [[About\|About]]  page which would give you more understanding on what this is.

**One last thing, Why dont you just write in Facebook?** oh, I can talk about it, [[Writings/Why I quit facebook?\|Why I quit facebook?]]
