Performance based bonuses or Incentives are no longer a fresh concept that would revolutionize the way your employees think or work. These bonuses were in existence since years and despite the mixed opinions these bonuses are considered quiet successfull in meeting its objectives.

At present, these are rewarded as per the number of objectives or milestones the employee met or by his work rate. These objectives or milestones could be varied from industry to industry. Which means, an objective to a doctor wont be similar to that of an engineer and by all means completing the objectives within the time frame would make them eligible for the rewards.

From the view of an employee, this is introduced to achieve higher workrate and a good competitive atmosphere among the employees in achieving their specific targets. A bit more dollars are attractive for anyone and thus they will utilise their resorces to push themselves to the reward. While this mentality is advantageous, this could result in few undesirable events.

According to Forbes Magazine, incentives, when designed poorly,can put a company’s sustainability at risk by paying out too much, incentivizing the wrong behaviors, or possibly driving people to game the system to meet their targets.

While the employers aim at the higher workrate and healthy competition among the employees, this could go in adverse as well. The performance based bonus could introduce jealousy and unhealthy competition between the employees and rather than conveying “work harder to achieve it next time” message it often conveys “Look at me, am better than all of you” message. Which is even capable of creating distinct packs and conspiracy groups within the employees, and that could be hazardous to the organization itself.

The resulted competition could also affect the consumers as well. For instance, lets make an example of hospital. If the doctors are getting bonuses for the maximum number of CT scans or the injections made, what would be the condition of the patients as many of the doctors would be sending them to unnecessary tests inorder to achieve their target.

The above scenario could happen in many industry where the client might be forced to take something without an option, just to achieve the target. Hence, These cases should be considered well as an unsatisfied customer is the last thing any business organization wants.

As we discussed the above cases, the next obvious question in our minds would be about the solution, and it starts with the proper job description. The employees should be well aware of their roles and the target to be achieved.

We can tackle the adverse affects by following the tips below:

- Design the program to drive both organizational and individual success.
		The performance based bonuse program should design well so that i could achieve the organizational success and the individual success, to achieve the correct dimension.

- Focus on both Long term and short term bonuses.
		Should include both short- and long-term goals to ensure employees receive ongoing performance feedback and continuous positive reinforcement for exhibiting the behaviors you want to see.

- Provide a variety of incentives.
		An organization could have many sectors and there should be variety of incentives to cover each sector, as a marketing sector target cant be compared to customer service target.

- Provide structured incentives rather than discretionary ones.
		Giving a structured goal to employee than a vague one is important.

- Make it transparent.
		The program should be transparent as the employees should be aware about the program and how its structured.

- Make sure incentives are financially sustainable.
		This is one of the important tip, as the company should not run out of finance after giving incentives, hence financial stability should be considered in prior.

- Ensure that the incentive program reflects the organization’s values.
		Incentive programs serves as a guide to the organization which clearly specifies what all are appreciated within the organizations and what arent. hence proper designing of the program is inevitable.

Incentive programs aren’t going away soon. Many organizations use these rewards to drive the behaviors they need to increase performance, while others have faced adverse consequences as a result of poorly designed programs.

Do not let incentives be the downfall of the organization. Make sure that the program resounds with company’s values and structured to drive behaviors that are beneficial in both organizational aspect and individual aspect.
