The fate, which is defined as “the set of things which is out of anyone’s control”, is often misunderstood by the majority, or to make things easy, lets say, misunderstood by me.

Whenever something happened to us, especially, something bad. We often thinks that oh god, not again, why me? then your mind starts working out, it may say that was it because of your past? was it because you didn’t worked hard? are you the one who has to be blamed or someone else?

When i was talking to my friend, they said me that, something isn’t going good, it was like that before, it is like this now, it won’t work good for them. So they decided it. it won’t work good for them. they just decided it. 

What i want to say now is, yes, it may be bad for you, it may be  bad then, but did you tried? did you tried to succeed it? yes? ah, then you must remember the fact that hardwork will pay off. you tried hard last time, you tried hard this time, and you should try hard next time as well. do you know why?

America’s greatest president Abraham Lincoln, got failed in number of election which can’t be counted in fingers. and now, he is remembered as the greatest president of all time.

Thats the beauty about all these. We doesn’t even know whats gonna happen next, we doesn’t know when our handwork gonna pay back? but the only thing we know is it will pay off, one day.

It may take time until the pay off. but the real thing is what you gonna do until then? curse your fate and raise blood pressure? or keep faith in your fate? does worrying too much gonna change your fate? does it really matters? then why are you worrying? stop it and play it cool.
