Regardless of your agreement, we all are passengers, who got into the train named life. Running behind things which we wants to own, satisfying the basic necessities of yourself from the available options around you, and spectating the wonderful sites outside via the windows.

Those in general compartment wants to get into sleeper class, those in sleeper wants 3tier AC, and then 2 tier and then first class. Thats how we are, we look into things that we don’t possess and get jealous or feel inferior about it. Though, the one who looks into themselves and feel happy are considered as the successful ones.

During this journey, we might get introduced to new people or they might just come to you, who changes their relationship status with you from stranger->acquaintance->to some other important roles, and thats the beauty about it, you never know who this guy/girl gonna be.

A simple, “hi-hello” could change things from absolute stranger to an inevitable part of your soul, they might capable enough to charge you up, might able to boost your limits, push you to something that you never thought you are capable of.

Thats how i met this co-passenger, who were chasing her dreams just like me, who had lot of priorities and had an extreme level of enthusiasm to learn new things, and that set her apart from 90% of souls i met during this journey. 

All those souls i met was reluctant to learn something, they were scared of learning new things and got coconut into the skill sets or luxuries that they already own. I never sensed an urge in them to learn anything ( may be thats my fault), and they couldn’t digest some facts they weren’t aware of, hence they mocked at everything.

But this girl, with the pile of confidence and the never-ending thirst to acquire knowledge, she literally blewed everything off. let that be history, psychology, programming, linguistic, anything, and that was simply awesome. 

From the the initial talks, which started by suggesting books to read, and gradually to everything, the relationship status grew bigger and important day by day.

As the journey continues, we might get introduced to new people again, but there will be those who remain as ours during the whole journey, during your lifetime, and nothing gonna change that. But future? who knows? who knows anything about the next set of railway tracks after this tunnels? who knows when the powerful-almighty TTR gonna put kick me out of the train which am in? atleast i don’t.

You may get introduced to many people in your lifetime, but only very few gets into your heart, and never leaves.
